# SynaesthetiQ Audio Capture

## A reduced fork of the SoundWeave program

This repo hosts a limited version of the SoundWeave library for testing in local environments. Instead of sending audio data over the internet, it is processed on the local machine.

## Update 150323
Incorporate the use of a ping pong buffer to store the captured audio data. This permits for more efficient processing.
